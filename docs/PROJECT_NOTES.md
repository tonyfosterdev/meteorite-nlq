# Project Notes
I want to extend my thanks for the opportunity to work on this project. It was a fun experience that let me explore interesting data and tools.

## Reconciliation of Product Spec with Current State and Timeline

I spent around 4â€“5 hours on this project, plus some additional time for cleanup and documentation. With more time, I would:
 * Add safeguards to the semantic parser by implementing a query intent system with predefined queries. This would enhance safety and reliability.
 * Implement additional view typesâ€”such as CSV downloads and map visualizations (e.g., with React Leaflet). I'd use an "Output Intent Parser" to 
I worked on this project for approximately 4-5 hours, with a little extra time for cleanup and documentation. With more time, I would have added safe guards to the semantic parser, implementing a query intent system with predefined queries. This is definitely a safer route. Additionally, I would have loved to add additional view types, like CSV downloads and maps, with a project like [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/).

Admittedly, this is the first time I used Next.js, so much of my time was spent getting my bearings in the project structure. The UI itself was pretty straightforward with Mantine and the semantic parsing was not too difficult.

Additionally, and I want to call this out specifically, I would add automated testing. I'm a test nerd: I _love_ writing tests and following TDD principles (to the extent it's practical). I chose not to with this project as it's a proof of concept and not intended for any real production usage. Under normal circumstances, you'd see unit and integration tests to verify core product functionality defined in the product specification.

Thanks again for reviewing!

I want to extend my thanks for the opportunity to work on this project. It was a fun experience that let me explore interesting data and tools.

## Reconciliation of Product Spec with Current State and Timeline
I spent around 4â€“5 hours on this project, plus some additional time for cleanup and documentation. With more time, I would:

- Add safeguards to the semantic parser by implementing an "Query Intent System" with predefined queries. This would enhance safety and reliability.  
- Implement an "Output Intent Parser" to determine the user's desired output format, ensuring queries return data in the most relevant way.  
- Implement additional view typesâ€”such as **CSV downloads** and **map visualizations** (e.g., with [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)). These would be chosen using the intended output from the "Output Intent System".

This was my first time using **Next.js**, so some of my effort went into understanding the project structure. The Mantine-based UI was straightforward, and the semantic parsing was relatively direct.

I also want to highlight that, under normal circumstances, I would add automated testing (unit and integration) to verify the core functionality outlined in the product specification. However, since this is a proof of concept rather than a production project, I opted not to include tests here. In real life, I'm a bit of test nerd, I love them! ðŸ¤“
