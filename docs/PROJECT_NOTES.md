# Project Notes

I want to extend my thanks for the opportunity to work on this project. It was a fun experience that let me explore interesting data and tools.

## Reconciliation of Product Spec with Current State and Timeline
I spent around 4â€“5 hours on this project, plus some additional time for cleanup and documentation. With more time, I would:

- Add safeguards to the semantic parser by implementing an "Query Intent System" with predefined queries. This would enhance safety and reliability.  
- Implement an "Output Intent Parser" to determine the user's desired output format, ensuring queries return data in the most relevant way.  
- Implement additional view typesâ€”such as **CSV downloads** and **map visualizations** (e.g., with [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)). These would be chosen using the intended output from the "Output Intent System".

This was my first time using **Next.js**, so some of my effort went into understanding the project structure. The Mantine-based UI was straightforward, and the semantic parsing was relatively direct.

I also want to highlight that, under normal circumstances, I would add automated testing (unit and integration) to verify the core functionality outlined in the product specification. However, since this is a proof of concept rather than a production project, I opted not to include tests here. In real life, I'm a bit of test nerd, I love them! ðŸ¤“

Thanks again for reviewing!
